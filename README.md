# Parliament 2.0

Welcome to Parliament 2.0! This project aims to create a digital parliament for the Government of Kenya, ensuring that every voice is heard and every vote counts. We highly value contributions, and your participation is crucial to our progress. Please read the [docs](https://github.com/21Summer-AI/parliament-2.0/blob/main/docs/architecture.txt) to understand what is being built. Feel free to recommend modifications and join the conversation in the discussions forum.

## Key Features of a Blockchain-Based Online Parliament

### Security and Integrity
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchainâ€™s immutable ledger ensures that all parliamentary records (votes, discussions, bills) are tamper-proof and verifiable.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate procedural rules and enforce compliance transparently and reliably.

### Transparency
- **Public Ledger**: Non-sensitive data can be made publicly accessible, allowing citizens to verify the actions and decisions of their representatives.
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive audit trails for every action, enhancing accountability.

### Decentralization
- **Distributed System**: Reduces the risk of single points of failure and enhances resilience against cyber-attacks.

### Efficiency
- **Automated Voting**: Secure and efficient electronic voting with instant tallying and verification.
- **Smart Contracts for Legislation**: Automate the enforcement of legislative rules and procedures.

## Implementation Steps

### Design and Development
1. **Platform Design**: Develop a blockchain-based platform tailored for parliamentary activities, integrating features like voting, debate, and documentation.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Create smart contracts to automate procedural rules, voting processes, and bill enactment.

### Security Measures
1. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication methods (e.g., digital signatures, multi-factor authentication) to ensure only authorized members can participate.
2. **Encryption**: Ensure all data, both in transit and at rest, is encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.

### Integration with Existing Systems
1. **Legacy Systems**: Ensure the new blockchain system can integrate with existing governmental IT infrastructure.
2. **Training**: Provide training for members and staff to familiarize them with the new system.

### Testing and Deployment
1. **Pilot Testing**: Run pilot tests to identify and address any issues before a full-scale launch.
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Gradually implement the system in stages to ensure a smooth transition.

### Regulatory and Legal Considerations
1. **Legal Framework**: Ensure that the implementation complies with existing legal frameworks and create new regulations if necessary.
2. **Data Privacy**: Adhere to data privacy regulations to protect the personal information of members and citizens.

## Example Workflow

1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - A member submits a legislative proposal via the blockchain platform.
   - The proposal is recorded on the blockchain and becomes visible to all members.

2. **Discussion and Debate**:
   - Members discuss and debate the proposal through the platform, with all comments and discussions recorded on the blockchain.

3. **Voting**:
   - When the debate concludes, a vote is initiated.
   - Members cast their votes electronically, and the blockchain ensures each vote is securely recorded and counted.

4. **Result Publication**:
   - The results are immediately available and transparent, with a permanent record on the blockchain.

5. **Implementation and Monitoring**:
   - If the proposal passes, smart contracts can automate certain implementation steps and monitor compliance with the new law.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Technological Barriers
- Ensuring robust and user-friendly technology that all members can use.
- Providing adequate IT support and infrastructure.

### Legal and Ethical Issues
- Addressing legal implications of digital governance.
- Ensuring ethical use of data and protection of member and citizen privacy.

### Adoption and Change Management
- Managing the transition from traditional to digital processes.
- Ensuring buy-in from all stakeholders, including parliament members, staff, and the public.

## Workspace Structure

This workspace contains three directories:

1. **contracts**: Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.
2. **scripts**: Contains four TypeScript files to deploy a contract. Instructions are below.
3. **tests**: Contains one Solidity test file for the 'Ballot' contract and one JS test file for the 'Storage' contract.

## Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains four TypeScript files which help deploy the 'Storage' contract using 'web3.js' and 'ethers.js' libraries.

- For deploying any other contract, update the contract's name from 'Storage' to the desired contract and provide constructor arguments accordingly in the file `deploy_with_ethers.ts` or `deploy_with_web3.ts`.

## Tests

In the `tests` folder, there is a script containing Mocha-Chai unit tests for the 'Storage' contract.

To run a script:
- Right-click on the file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'.
- Remember, the Solidity file must already be compiled. Output from the script will appear in the Remix terminal.

Please note, require/import is supported in a limited manner for Remix supported modules. Supported modules by Remix are ethers, web3, swarmgw, chai, multihashes, remix, and hardhat (only for hardhat.ethers object/plugin). For unsupported modules, an error like '<module_name> module require is not supported by Remix IDE' will be shown.
